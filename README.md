# Password guessing using machine learning from wearables

Wearables are now ubiquitous items equipped with a multitude of sensors such as GPS, accelerometer, or Bluetooth. The raw data from this sensors are typically used in a health context, however it can also be used for security purposes. For example, wearables can provide continuous authentication for smartphones.

The project goes one step further and proposes using wearables for identifying users' passwords. The raw data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms for discovering the text typed.
